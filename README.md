# Schrodingers-Closet
Welcome to the closet. We are an opensource organizational tool that can help you afford the stuff you want while helping your community and the environment

Say you want to buy a textbook and you are only going to need it a couple days a week in the afternoon. Say you also don't want to pay full price for that textbook. This platform helps you post and find timeshares for every day items like your textbooks. Simply post your item or search for matching items in your area.

With our service you are able to use resources more efficiently while also saving money. Posting have start and end dates and if participants keep with checking in and sharing items for the duration of the posting they will be reimbursed an equal share of the cost of the item.
